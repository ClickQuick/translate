Translate Click Quick! so the world can have fun

## About

Click Quick! (here-on CQ) is a fun game, then again, I am the developer, but one problem is that I only speak english, so the application is written in english. However, I do want to change that. I could pay a translator to translate, but that costs money. I could also use sites such as Google Translate, but sometimes they are not reliable. So I wanted start something that I have never seen in the app development community: community translating.

What is community translating? That's a good question. Pretty much, all it means is that if you can speak English and another language, then you can contribute your knowlege, for free, to help make CQ avalible in all languages. To my kowlege, this has never been done before, so I am really interested in how this will play out. 

## How it works

The site you are on right now is called GitHub. It is a website used by developers to host our code primarily. Basically its like iCloud for computer programs plus a lot of nifty features that Im not going to go into. This file thast you are reading is in whats called a repository, or repo. The repo's name is called "translate" and a repo is just a collection of files pretty much. 

In this repo, you will see a file called `base.strings`. This file contains every single English word that can be found in CQ, followed by an equals sign, and the the English version again. 

To contribute to the translation of CQ, download the `base.strings` file to your computer, and open it. You then can trnalate the English words on the left of the `=` sign, and paste your translation into the right of the `=` sign.

Here is an example:

#### Example

The orginal base.strings you have just downloaded

```
"Hello" = "Hello";
"My name is" = "My name is";
```
What base.strings should look like **after** you translate it to your language
```
"Hello" = "Hola";
"My name is" = "Mi nombre es";
```


## Uploading

Once you have changed everything in the file, you will then fill out this Google Form. You will be asked for your email, name, and for the file to be uploaded. I will **not** publish your email, at all. It is only used so I can contact you after you have submitted your translation so I can thank you and let you know when it will be implemented into CQ.
