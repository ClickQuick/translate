Translate Click Quick! so the world can have fun

## About

Click Quick! (here-on CQ) is a fun game, then again, I am the developer, but one problem is that I only speak english, so the application is written in english. However, I do want to change that. I could pay a translator to translate, but that costs money. I could also use sites such as Google Translate, but sometimes they are not reliable. So I wanted start something that I have never seen in the app development community: community translating.

What is community translating? That's a good question. Pretty much, all it means is that if you can speak English and another language, then you can contribute your knowlege, for free, to help make CQ avalible in all languages. To my kowlege, this has never been done before, so I am really interested in how this will play out. 

## How it works

The site you are on right now is called GitHub. It is a website used by developers to host our code primarily. Basically its like iCloud for computer programs plus a lot of nifty features that Im not going to go into. This file thast you are reading is in whats called a repository, or repo. The repo's name is called "translate" and a repo is just a collection of files pretty much. 

In this repo, you will see a file called 'base.strings'.
